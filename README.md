Ghost
=====

A gem that allows you to create, list, and modify local hostnames
with ease in linux and OS (more to come)...

Requirements
============

Unix-based OS (for now)

Intended Usage
==============

This gem is designed primarily for web developers who need to add
and modify hostnames to their system for virtual hosts on their
local/remote web server. However, it could be of use to other people
who would otherwise modify their `/etc/hosts` file manually and
flush the cache.

Command
-------

    $ ghost add mydevsite.local
      [Adding] mydevsite.local -> 127.0.0.1

    $ ghost add staging-server.local 67.207.136.164
      [Adding] staging-server.local -> 67.207.136.164

    $ ghost list
    Listing 2 host(s):
      mydevsite.local      -> 127.0.0.1
      staging-server.local -> 67.207.136.164

    $ ghost delete mydevsite.local
      [Deleting] mydevsite.local

    $ ghost delete_matching test
      [Deleting] test2.local
      [Deleting] test.local

    $ ghost list
    Listing 1 host(s):
      staging-server.local -> 67.207.136.164

    $ ghost modify staging-server.local 64.233.167.99
      [Modifying] staging-server.local -> 64.233.167.99

    $ ghost list
    Listing 1 host(s):
      staging-server.local -> 64.233.167.99

    $ ghost export > some_file

    $ ghost empty
      [Emptying] Done.

    $ ghost list
    Listing 0 host(s):

    $ ghost import some_file
      [Adding] staging-server.local -> 64.233.167.99

    $ ghost list
    Listing 1 host(s):
      staging-server.local -> 64.233.167.99

With RVM you need to add `rvmsudo` before the command:

    $ rvmsudo ghost add mydevsite.local
      [Adding] mydevsite.local -> 127.0.0.1

Library
-------

There is also a library that can be used in Ruby scripts. The `ghost`
command is a wrapper for the library. View the source of `bin/ghost`
to see how to use the library.

Installation
============

    sudo gem install ghost
